# Dashboard Implementation Guide

## Overview

Successfully implemented role-based dashboard redirect after login with separate Admin and User dashboards.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created UserDashboard.js (`/dashboard`)

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/UserDashboard.js`

**Features:**

- Welcome message with user's name
- Profile information card (email, name, phone, address)
- Order history display with status tracking
- Quick action buttons (Shop Now, My Cart, Roofing, Accessories)
- Empty state when no orders exist
- Protected route - redirects to login if not authenticated

**API Endpoints Used:**

- `GET /api/orders/user/{userId}` - Fetch user's orders

### 2. Created AdminDashboard.js (`/admin-dashboard`)

**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.js`

**Features:**

- Statistics cards (Total Users, Products, Orders, Pending Orders)
- Quick action buttons (Manage Products, Manage Users, Reports, Settings)
- Recent orders table with order status management
- Dropdown to update order status directly
- Protected route - redirects non-admin users to regular dashboard

**API Endpoints Used:**

- `GET /api/users` - Fetch all users
- `GET /api/products` - Fetch all products
- `GET /api/orders` - Fetch all orders
- `PUT /api/orders/{orderId}/status` - Update order status

### 3. Updated Login.js

**Changes:**

- ✅ Changed from `response.text()` to `response.json()`
- ✅ Added `useNavigate` hook for programmatic navigation
- ✅ Parse user object from backend response
- ✅ Store complete user object in localStorage
- ✅ Redirect based on user role:
  - `ADMIN` → `/admin-dashboard`
  - `USER` → `/dashboard`
- ✅ Added loading state with disabled button during login
- ✅ Better error handling with try-catch

### 4. Created Dashboard.css

**Location:** `frontend/src/assets/styles/Dashboard.css`

**Styles:**

- Gradient headers with animations
- Responsive grid layouts
- Card-based design with hover effects
- Status badges with color coding
- Mobile-responsive design (3 breakpoints)
- Modern color scheme with purple gradient theme

### 5. Updated App.js

**New Routes:**

```javascript
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<UserDashboard />} />
<Route path="/admin-dashboard" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
```

## How to Test

### Test User Login:

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with: `user@toproof.com` / `user123`
3. Should redirect to `/dashboard` (User Dashboard)
4. See profile, orders (if any), and quick actions

### Test Admin Login:

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with: `admin@toproof.com` / `admin123`
3. Should redirect to `/admin-dashboard` (Admin Dashboard)
4. See statistics, recent orders, and admin actions
5. Try updating order status from dropdown

## Backend Response Structure

The backend `/api/auth/login` returns:

```json
{
  "message": "Login successful!",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "admin@toproof.com",
    "firstName": "Admin",
    "lastName": "User",
    "role": "ADMIN",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "address": "123 Admin St",
    "createdAt": "2025-06-25T21:19:04.415"
  }
}
```

## Security Notes

- Both dashboards check for authentication on mount
- Admin dashboard validates role and redirects non-admins
- User data stored in localStorage (consider using secure storage in production)
- Protected routes redirect to login if not authenticated

## Next Steps

You can enhance the dashboards by:

1. Adding more statistics to admin dashboard
2. Implementing profile editing functionality
3. Adding order filtering and search
4. Implementing product management UI in admin dashboard
5. Adding user management interface
6. Creating reports and analytics pages
